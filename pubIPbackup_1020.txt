Hello. This is a backup of the file below:
cat /etc/nginx/sites-available/18.216.58.166
made by WLC on oct 20 2020, in case his tutorial about setting up uWSGI/nginx goes horribly wrong.

server {
        listen 80;
        listen [::]:80;
        server_name 18.216.58.166;

	location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8080/;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Accept-Encoding gzip;
        }

	location /test {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:82/;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Accept-Encoding gzip;
        }
    }
